RVezy Technical Challenge

Code is available and definitely didn't have enough time.

It tries to do most of Task 1 with a very minimal unit test to ilustrate the idea but missing:
 - Proper set of data for mock (substitute)
 - Proper validations / error handling (there's none on the project)
 - Proper data mappings (REST controllers vs Data Entities)
 
For Level 2 tasks, the intention was to use the Repository pattern (started but had no time, see classes)
